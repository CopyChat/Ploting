This directory contains a Power Point Presentation given at the AMS
Annual Meeting in January, 2013 that presents a workflow for acquiring
and managing CMIP5 data.

Included in the workflow are some scripts to make the CMIP5 data
friendly for GrADS. These scripts and other utilities work for me but
your mileage may vary -- you will certainly have to adjust path names
to match your own data management conventions. A brief description of
how I organize things is in the PPT presentation. You will also have
to acquire and build the NetCDF library, the NetCDF operators, and the
ESMF_RegridWeightGen utility. Please ask the providers for help with
these tasks. The two C programs are straightforward to build, please
see comments in the programs and scripts for further documentation. 


A brief descriptor of files in this directory follows:

AMS2013.pptx     == The PPT Presentation
dummy_365day.ctl == dummy descriptor file used by write_xtl.gs and write_ctl.gs
dummy_day.ctl    == dummy descriptor file used by write_xtl.gs and write_ctl.gs
dummy_mon.ctl    == dummy descriptor file used by write_xtl.gs and write_ctl.gs
dummy_stub.ctl   == dummy descriptor file used by write_xtl.gs and write_ctl.gs
dummy.dat        == 0-byte file that appears in the DSET entry of dummy*.ctl
get_basin.sh     == shell script to get the size of the basin dimension from a CMIP5 file
get_calendar.sh  == shell script to get the calendar attribute value from a CMIP5 file
isfile.sh*       == shell script to determine if a file exists
linear0p5.nc     == netcdf file that describes the destination grid for ESMF_RegridWeightGen (SCRIP format)
weights2pdef.c   == C program to convert interpolation weights into a PDEF file for use with GrADS
wordof.c         == C program for parsing strings, called by get_basin.sh and get_calendar.sh
write_xtl.gs     == GrADS script to generate xdfopen-style descriptors for CMIP5 data
write_ctl.gs     == GrADS script to generate full descriptors and PDEF files for CMIP5 data on non-rectilinear grids


You will also need:
  ncdump (a utility in the NetCDF library), 
  ncks (a Netcdf Operator)
  ESFM_RegridWeightGen (a utility in the ESMF software package)

Much of this code is glorified string parsing. I know there are many
ways to do this, and what is presented here may not be the best or most 
efficient, is it merely what was easiest for me.
